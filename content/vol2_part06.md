[**Part VI Review**](vol2_part-p06.md#part-p06)

[Part VI](vol2_part06.md#part06) of this book includes most of the network automation topics from the CCNA blueprint; however, this part includes as much discussion of how Cisco and others have changed the way networks work to enable better automation as it discusses tools and processes to automate networks.

[Chapters 21](vol2_ch21.md#ch21) and [22](vol2_ch22.md#ch22) examine a wide range of products and architectures that also enable better operations and automation. [Chapter 21](vol2_ch21.md#ch21) discusses how controllers can separate out part of the work formerly done by networking devices. The chapter shows the advantages of these new controller-based models and details a few examples. [Chapter 22](vol2_ch22.md#ch22) then goes on to give more detail about Cisco Software-Defined Access (Cisco SD-Access), a controller-based networking approach to building enterprise campus networks.

[Chapters 23](vol2_ch23.md#ch23) and [24](vol2_ch24.md#ch24) discuss a few more specific details about network automation. Controllers typically include REST APIs and often return data to automation programs in the form of formatted data like JSON. [Chapter 23](vol2_ch23.md#ch23) introduces these concepts. [Chapter 24](vol2_ch24.md#ch24) then moves on to discuss IT automation tools, specifically Ansible and Terraform.
