[**Part II Review**](vol2_part-p02.md#part-p02)

The *CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2*, Second Edition, includes the topics that help you build an enterprise network so all devices can communicate with all other devices. [Parts II](vol2_part02.md#part02) and [III](vol2_part03.md#part03) of this book focus on how to secure that enterprise network so that only the appropriate devices and users can communicate.

[Part II](vol2_part02.md#part02) focuses on IP Version 4 (IPv4) access control lists (ACLs). ACLs are IPv4 packet filters that can be programmed to look at IPv4 packet headers, make choices, and either allow a packet through or discard the packet. Because you can implement IPv4 ACLs on any router, a network engineer has many options of where to use ACLs, without adding additional hardware or software, making ACLs a very flexible and useful tool.

[Chapter 5](vol2_ch05.md#ch05) begins this part with an introduction to the TCP/IP Transport layer protocols TCP and UDP, along with an introduction to several TCP/IP applications. This chapter provides the necessary background to understand the ACL chapters.

[Chapters 6](vol2_ch06.md#ch06), [7](vol2_ch07.md#ch07), and [8](vol2_ch08.md#ch08) get into details about ACLs. [Chapter 6](vol2_ch06.md#ch06) discusses ACL basics, avoiding advanced topics to ensure that you master the basics. [Chapter 7](vol2_ch07.md#ch07) explores named ACLs, which allow easier configuration and editing, and extended ACLs, which provide more options to match packets. [Chapter 8](vol2_ch08.md#ch08) completes the ACL discussion by examining specific implementation issues, first regarding several overhead protocols, and then discussing some improved ACL features introduced by IOS XE.
