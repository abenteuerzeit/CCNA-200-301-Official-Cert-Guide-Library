*Wendell Odom:*

For Raymond Lanier Odom, still the best dad ever.

*Jason Gooley:*

To my family: Mother, thank you for always being my guiding light from up above. To my wife, Jamie, your love and support mean the world to me. To my children, Kaleigh and Jaxon, always believe in yourself and go for your dreams, no matter how lofty they may seem. To my father, thanks for believing in that stubborn kid so many years ago! To my brother, thanks for always having my back broham. Thank you, God--without you none of this would be possible!
