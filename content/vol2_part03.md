[**Part III Review**](vol2_part-p03.md#part-p03)

Before the year 2020, Cisco offered several CCNA certifications. Those included CCNA Routing and Switching as well as CCNA Security. In 2020, Cisco discontinued all of those, replacing them with one CCNA certification. That CCNA certification mostly resembled CCNA Routing and Switching, but with some parts of CCNA Security and CCNA Wireless included. The current CCNA certification, based on the 200-301 Exam's Version 1.1 blueprint, continues to include meaningful security and wireless LAN content.

[Part III](vol2_part03.md#part03) of this book discusses the largest security topics from Domain 5 of the blueprint, while leaving some security topics to other parts of the books. For instance, the wireless LAN security topics in that domain reside in [Part I](vol2_part01.md#part01) of this book, along with the rest of the Wireless LAN materials. This part, [Part III](vol2_part03.md#part03), includes all standalone security topics.

[Chapter 9](vol2_ch09.md#ch09) kicks off [Part III](vol2_part03.md#part03) with a wide description of security threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits. This introductory chapter sets the stage to help you think more like a security engineer.

[Chapters 10](vol2_ch10.md#ch10), [11](vol2_ch11.md#ch11), and [12](vol2_ch12.md#ch12) then focus on a wide range of short security topics. Those topics include [Chapter 10](vol2_ch10.md#ch10)'s discussion of how to protect router and switch logins and passwords, along with an introduction to the functions and roles of firewalls or intrusion protection systems (IPSs). [Chapters 11](vol2_ch11.md#ch11) and [12](vol2_ch12.md#ch12) then get into three separate security features built into Cisco switches: port security (covered in [Chapter 11](vol2_ch11.md#ch11)), DHCP Snooping, and Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) (both covered in [Chapter 12](vol2_ch12.md#ch12)). All three security features use a LAN switch to examine frames as they enter the switch interface. This information enables port security, DHCP Snooping, and DAI to decide whether to allow the message to continue on its way.
