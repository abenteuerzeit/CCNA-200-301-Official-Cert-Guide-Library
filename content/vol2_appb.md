# Appendix B


## Exam Topics Cross-Reference

This appendix lists the exam topics defined in the CCNA 200-301 exam blueprint version 1.1. Cisco lists the exam topics on its website. Even though changes to the exam topics are rare, you should always review those exam topics for any updates; check [www.cisco.com/go/certifications](http://www.cisco.com/go/certifications) and navigate to the correct exam.

Cisco organizes each list of exam topics by domains, which are major topic areas. Cisco states the percentage of the exam that should come from each exam, so you get some idea of the areas of importance. Traditionally, the score report you receive after taking the exam shows your percentage score in each domain.

This appendix includes two separate types of indices to exam topics:

* **CCNA 200-301 Version 1.1 Blueprint Order:** This section uses the same order as the CCNA 200-301 V1.1 exam blueprint document. This first list shows a cross-reference from each exam topic to the chapters that include at least some material about each topic.
* **Book Chapter Order:** This section lists the chapters in this book, along with the exam topics that the chapter includes. This section basically relists the kind of information found on the first page of each chapter, just in condensed form in one place.

### CCNA 200-301 Exam Topic Order

The CCNA 200-301 exam includes six major topic areas (domains), each with a percentage listed. [Table B-1](vol2_appb.md#appbtab01) lists the domains and their percentages.

**Table B-1** CCNA 200-301 Version 1.1 Exam Topic Domains

| Domain | Percentage |
| --- | --- |
| Domain 1: Network Fundamentals | 20% |
| Domain 2: Network Access | 20% |
| Domain 3: IP Connectivity | 25% |
| Domain 4: IP Services | 10% |
| Domain 5: Security Fundamentals | 15% |
| Domain 6: Automation and Programmability | 10% |

[Tables B-2](vol2_appb.md#appbtab02) through [B-7](vol2_appb.md#appbtab07) list the exam topics within each of the six domains. Note that the *CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1,* Second Edition, covers some of the exam topics, while this book covers the rest. These tables show the chapters in this book; look to the equivalent appendix in Volume 1 for details of exam topic coverage in that book.

### Book Chapters, with Exam Topics Covered in Each

Cisco organizes its exam topics based on the outcome of your learning experience, which is typically not a reasonable order for building the content of a book or course. This section lists this book's chapters in sequence, with the exam topics covered in each chapter.
