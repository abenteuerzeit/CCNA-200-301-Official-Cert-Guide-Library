Use these videos to challenge your thinking, dig deeper, review topics, and better prepare for the exam. Make sure to bookmark a link to the companion website and use the videos for review whenever you have a few extra minutes.

### Subnetting Exercises

[Chapters 12](vol1_ch12.xhtml#ch12) through [15](vol1_ch15.xhtml#ch15) list some subnetting exercises, along with time and accuracy goals. Now is a good time to work on those goals. Some options include the following:

**Practice from this book's appendices or web applications:** This book includes four appendices of subnetting practice exercises, all available from the companion website. From that website, to use the static PDFs, look to the section titled "Study Resources." To find the interactive versions of the exercises in those same appendices, look to the section titled "Memory Tables and Practice Exercises." Look for these topics/appendices:

[Appendix D](vol1_appd.xhtml#appd), "[Practice for Chapter 12: Analyzing Classful IPv4 Networks](vol1_appd.xhtml#appd)"

[Appendix E](vol1_appe.xhtml#appe), "[Practice for Chapter 13: Analyzing Subnet Masks](vol1_appe.xhtml#appe)"

[Appendix F](vol1_appf.xhtml#appf), "[Practice for Chapter 14: Analyzing Existing Subnets](vol1_appf.xhtml#appf)"

[Appendix G](vol1_appg.xhtml#appg), "[Practice for Chapter 15: Subnet Design](vol1_appg.xhtml#appg)"

**IP Subnetting Practice Question Kit:** As mentioned in the Introduction to the book, if you want large amounts of subnetting practice, with explanations that match the processes in the book, consider purchasing the IP Subnetting Practice Question Kit, available at [ciscopress.com](http://ciscopress.com).

**Author's blog:** I've written a few dozen subnetting exercises on the blog over the years. Just look at the Questions menu item at the top of the page, and you will see a variety of IPv4 addressing and subnetting question types. Start at <https://www.certskills.com>.
