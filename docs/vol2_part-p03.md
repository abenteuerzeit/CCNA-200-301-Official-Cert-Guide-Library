### Review Key Topics

### Do Labs

Depending on your chosen lab tool, here are some suggestions for what to do in lab:

**Pearson Network Simulator:** If you use the full Pearson CCNA simulator, focus more on the configuration scenario and troubleshooting scenario labs associated with the topics in this part of the book. These types of labs include a larger set of topics and work well as Part Review activities. (See the Introduction for some details about how to find which labs are about topics in this part of the book.)

**Blog Config Labs:** The author's blog (<https://www.certskills.com>) includes a series of configuration-focused labs that you can do on paper, each in 10â€“15 minutes. Review and performs labs for this part of the book by using the menus to navigate to the per-chapter content and then finding all config labs related to that chapter. (You can see more detailed instructions at <https://www.certskills.com/config-labs>.)

**Other:** If using other lab tools, here are a few suggestions: make sure to experiment with the variety of configuration topics in this part, including router and switch passwords, switch port security, Dynamic ARP Inspection, and DHCP Snooping.

### Watch Videos

Two chapters in this part mention videos included as extra material related to those chapters. Check out the reference in [Chapter 9](vol2_ch09.xhtml#ch09) to a video about using RADIUS protocol, as well as [Chapter 10](vol2_ch10.xhtml#ch10)'s reference to a video about troubleshooting switch port security.
