[**Part VI Review**](vol1_part-p06.xhtml#part-p06)

[Part IV](vol1_part04.xhtml#part04) began the story in this book about IP Version 4 (IPv4) addressing. [Part V](vol1_part05.xhtml#part05) continued that story with how to implement addressing in Cisco routers, along with a variety of methods to route packets between local interfaces. But those topics delayed the discussion of one of the most important topics in TCP/IP, namely IP routing protocols, as discussed in [Part VI](vol1_part06.xhtml#part06).

Routers use IP routing protocols to learn about the subnets in an internetwork, choose the current-best routes to reach each subnet, and add those routes to each router's IP routing table. Cisco chose to include one and only one IP routing protocol in the CCNA 200-301 Version 1.1 blueprint: the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) routing protocol. This entire part focuses on OSPF as an end to itself and to show the principles of routing protocols.
