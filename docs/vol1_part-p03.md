Depending on your chosen lab tool, here are some suggestions for what to do in the labs:

**Pearson Network Simulator:** If you use the full Pearson CCNA simulator, focus more on the configuration scenario and troubleshooting scenario labs associated with the topics in this part of the book. These types of labs include a larger set of topics and work well as Part Review activities. (See the Introduction for some details about how to find which labs are about topics in this part of the book.) Note that the Sim Lite that comes with this book also has a couple of labs about VLANs.

**Blog: Config Labs:** The author's blog includes a series of configuration-focused labs that you can do on paper or with Cisco Packet Tracer in about 15 minutes. To find them, open <https://www.certskills.com> and look under the Labs menu item.

**Other:** If using other lab tools, as a few suggestions: make sure to experiment heavily with VLAN configuration and VLAN trunking configuration.

### Dig Deeper with Appendices on the Companion Website

* **[Appendix L](vol1_appl.xhtml#appl), "[LAN Troubleshooting](vol1_appl.xhtml#appl)":** An appendix from the previous edition of the book. It includes topics about VLANs, trunks, and STP and how to troubleshoot each.
