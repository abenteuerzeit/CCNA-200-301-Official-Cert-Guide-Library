### Repeat All DIKTA Questions

For this task, use the PTP software to answer the "Do I Know This Already?" questions again for the chapters in this part of the book.

### Answer Part Review Questions

For this task, use PTP to answer the Part Review questions for this part of the book.

### Review Key Topics

Review all key topics in all chapters in this part, either by browsing the chapters or by using the Key Topics application on the companion website.

### Do Labs

Depending on your chosen lab tool, here are some suggestions for what to do in lab:

**Pearson Network Simulator:** If you use the full Pearson CCNA simulator, focus more on the configuration scenario and troubleshooting scenario labs associated with the topics in this part of the book. These types of labs include a larger set of topics and work well as Part Review activities. (See the Introduction for some details about how to find which labs are about topics in this part of the book.)

**Config Labs:** The author's blog (<https://www.certskills.com>) includes a series of configuration-focused labs that you can do on paper, each in 10â€“15 minutes. Review and perform labs for this part of the book by using the menus to navigate to the per-chapter content and then finding all config labs related to that chapter. (You can see more detailed instructions at <https://www.certskills.com/config-labs>).

**Other:** If you are using other lab tools, here are a few suggestions: when building ACL labs, you can test with Telnet (port 23), SSH (port 22), ping (ICMP), and traceroute (UDP) traffic as generated from an extra router. So, do not just configure the ACL; make an ACL that can match these types of traffic, denying some and permitting others, and then test.

### Use Per-Chapter Interactive Review

Using the companion website, browse through the interactive review elements, like memory tables and key term flashcards, to review the content from each chapter.
