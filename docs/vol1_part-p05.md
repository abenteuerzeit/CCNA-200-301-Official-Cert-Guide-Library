### Answer Part Review Questions

For this task, use PTP to answer the Part Review questions for this part of the book.

### Review Key Topics

Review all key topics in all chapters in this part, either by browsing the chapters or by using the Key Topics application on the companion website.

### Do Labs

Depending on your chosen lab tool, here are some suggestions for what to do in lab:

**Pearson Network Simulator:** If you use the full Pearson CCNA simulator, focus more on the configuration scenario and troubleshooting scenario labs associated with the topics in this part of the book. These types of labs include a larger set of topics and work well as Part Review activities. (See the Introduction for some details about how to find which labs are about topics in this part of the book.)

**Blog Config Labs:** The author's blog includes a series of configuration-focused labs that you can do on paper or with Cisco Packet Tracer in about 15 minutes. To find them, open <https://www.certskills.com> and look under the Labs menu item.

**Other:** If using other lab tools, here are a few suggestions: Make sure to experiment heavily with IPv4 addressing, static routing, and Layer 3 switching. In each case, test all your routes using **ping** and **traceroute**.

### Watch Video

The companion website includes a variety of common mistake and Q&A videos organized by part and chapter. Use these videos to challenge your thinking, dig deeper, review topics, and better prepare for the exam. Make sure to bookmark a link to the companion website and use the videos for review whenever you have a few extra minutes.
