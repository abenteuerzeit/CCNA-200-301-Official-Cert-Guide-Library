### Repeat All DIKTA Questions

For this task, answer the "Do I Know This Already?" questions again for the chapters in this part of the book, using the PTP software.

### Answer Part Review Questions

For this task, answer the Part Review questions for this part of the book, using the PTP software.

### Review Key Topics

Review all key topics in all chapters in this part, either by browsing the chapters or by using the Key Topics application on the companion website.

### Labs

Depending on your chosen lab tool, here are some suggestions for what to do in lab:

**Pearson Network Simulator:** If you use the full Pearson ICND1 or CCNA simulator, focus more on the configuration scenario and troubleshooting scenario labs associated with the topics in this part of the book. These types of labs include a larger set of topics and work well as Part Review activities. (See the Introduction for some details about how to find which labs are about topics in this part of the book.)

**Blog: Config Labs:** The author's blog includes a series of configuration-focused labs that you can do on paper or with Cisco Packet Tracer in about 15 minutes. To find them, open <https://www.certskills.com> and look under the Labs menu item.

**Other:** If using other lab tools, as a few suggestions: make sure to experiment heavily with VLAN configuration and VLAN trunking configuration. Also, spend some time changing interface settings like **speed** and **duplex** on a link between two switches, to make sure that you understand which cases would result in a duplex mismatch.

### Review Appendix L on the Companion Website

[Appendix L](vol1_appl.xhtml#appl) on the companion website contains a chapter from the previous edition of the book that focused on troubleshooting. That appendix, named "[LAN Troubleshooting](vol1_appl.xhtml#appl)," can be useful as a tool to review the topics in this part of the book. (Note that if you use this extra appendix, you can ignore the mentions of Port Security until you have reached that topic in the *CCNA 200-301 Official Cert Guide, Volume 2*, Second Edition.)

### Watch Videos

The companion website includes a variety of common mistake and Q&A videos organized by part and chapter. Use these videos to challenge your thinking, dig deeper, review topics, and better prepare for the exam. Make sure to bookmark a link to the companion website and use the videos for review whenever you have a few extra minutes.

### Use Per-Chapter Interactive Review

Using the companion website, browse through the interactive review elements, like memory tables and key term flashcards, to review the content from each chapter.
