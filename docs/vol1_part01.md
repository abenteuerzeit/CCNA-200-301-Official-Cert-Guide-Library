[**Part I Review**](vol1_part-p01.xhtml#part-p01)

This first part of the book introduces the fundamentals of the most important topics in TCP/IP networking. [Chapter 1](vol1_ch01.xhtml#ch01) provides a broad look at TCP/IP, introducing the common terms, big concepts, and major protocols for TCP/IP. [Chapter 2](vol1_ch02.xhtml#ch02) then examines local-area networks (LANs), which are networks that connect devices that are located near to each other, for instance, in the same building. [Chapter 3](vol1_ch03.xhtml#ch03) then shows how to connect those LANs across long distances with wide-area networks (WANs) with a focus on how routers connect LANs and WANs to forward data between any two devices in the network.
